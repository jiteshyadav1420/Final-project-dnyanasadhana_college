# Project Phase 2: Advanced SQL Queries and Database Operations

## Summary

In **Phase 2** of the project, advanced SQL queries and database operations were implemented to interact with the **Dnyanasadhana College** database. The focus was on applying **DDL (Data Definition Language)**, **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**, and **DQL (Data Query Language)** to perform various tasks such as retrieving, updating, deleting, and modifying data across multiple tables.

### Key Activities:
1. **Data Retrieval**: 
   - Queries were written to retrieve specific data from tables like `Students`, `Departments`, `Professors`, `Courses`, and others using conditions, sorting, and grouping.
   - Examples include finding students in a specific department, counting female students, and retrieving courses with more than 3 credits.

2. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Records were updated, deleted, and inserted into tables. For example, updating a student's email, deleting a department, or adding a new column to the `Professors` table.
   - Operations like increasing professor salaries by 10% and updating exam pass marks were performed.

3. **Table Modifications**:
   - Tables were altered to add new columns, modify existing columns, or rename columns. For example, adding a `Middle_Name` column to the `Students` table and renaming the `Phone_Number` column to `Contact_Number` in the `Departments` table.

4. **Aggregate Functions**:
   - Aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `SUM` were used to calculate totals, averages, and counts. For example, counting the number of departments in each building or finding the average class duration.

5. **Grouping and Filtering**:
   - Data was grouped and filtered using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses. For example, counting the number of courses per semester or finding the student with the most library issues.

6. **Advanced Queries**:
   - Complex queries were written to find the highest values, such as the department with the highest budget, the professor with the earliest hire date, or the course with the highest enrollment limit.

7. **Cascading Operations**:
   - Cascading operations like `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` were applied to maintain data integrity when deleting or updating related records.

8. **Data Analysis**:
   - Queries were used to analyze data, such as counting the number of events per organizer, finding the scholarship with the highest amount, or retrieving all placements with a package greater than $1,000,000.

### Conclusion:
Phase 2 focused on enhancing the database's functionality by implementing advanced SQL queries and operations. These queries allow for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis, ensuring the database can handle complex college operations effectively. The project demonstrates the ability to manage and interact with a large-scale database system using SQL.
